Pulsar stars, characterized by their highly magnetized and rapidly rotating compact nature, as well
as their emission of radiation beams from magnetic poles, play a crucial role in astrophysics, par‐
ticularly in the study of gravitational waves and general relativity. This paper investigates the
application of machine learning techniques for the classifications of pulsars using radio wave
emission data from the HTRU‐2 dataset, which contains an extensive collection of candidate sam‐
ples. The study explores two quantum‐assisted methodologies: a 9‐qubit Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) inspired encoding and an innovative single‐qubit Quantum Asymp‐
totically Universal Multi‐feature (QAUM) encoding within a quantum neural network framework.
The performance evaluation encompasses a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, re‐
call, and specificity, which are analyzed across various optimizer configurations and learning rates.
Notably, the QAUM approach consistently demonstrates superior sensitivity and reduced error
rates compared to QAOA, particularly in specific learning rate settings. These findings underscore
the transformative potential of quantum computing in advancing pulsar detection methodologies,
highlighting its efficacy and implications for astrophysical data analysis and the broader field of
quantum‐enhanced scientific exploration.
